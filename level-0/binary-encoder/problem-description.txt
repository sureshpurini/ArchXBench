Title: 8-to-3 Binary Encoder

Objective:
Design an 8-to-3 binary encoder that outputs the binary representation of the index of the highest active input, assuming one-hot input.

Background:
Binary encoders are combinational circuits that reduce multiple input lines to a binary representation. A binary encoder is simple but assumes that only one input is active (one-hot input). This makes it suitable for controlled environments where inputs are guaranteed to be mutually exclusive.

Design Constraints:
- The binary encoder assumes only one input is high at a time.
- The design should be purely combinational.
- When the input vector has no bits set or more than one bit set, the encoder must drive its outputs to 0
- Any X or Z on any input bit must propagate through so that the corresponding output bits become X


Performance Expectation:
The binary encoder is a minimal-delay, low-area component due to its simple logic structure.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the binary encoder.
