Title: 8-bit Serial-In Parallel-Out (SIPO) Shift Register

Objective:
Design an 8-bit SIPO shift register that shifts data in serially and allows parallel reading of all bits.

Background:
SIPO shift registers are used to expand serial data into parallel form, enabling wider data processing or storage after serial reception.

Design Constraints:
- The design must be synchronous and triggered on the rising edge of a clock.
- Support for synchronous reset is required.

Performance Expectation:
The register should allow correct serial-to-parallel conversion with stable parallel outputs after shifting.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the 8-bit SIPO shift register.
