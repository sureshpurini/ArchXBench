Title: 4-to-1 Multiplexer using 2-to-1 Multiplexers

Objective:
Design a 4-to-1 multiplexer by hierarchically using only 2-to-1 multiplexers. The objective is to understand modularity and hierarchical construction in logic design.

Background:
Larger multiplexers (e.g., 4-to-1) can be built using smaller ones like 2-to-1 MUXes, which demonstrates hierarchical and reusable design principles â€” a key concept in digital hardware architecture.

Design Constraints:
- The 4-to-1 MUX must be built entirely using multiple instances of the 2-to-1 MUX (no direct logic expressions).
- The design must be combinational (no clocking or memory elements).

Performance Expectation:
The 4-to-1 multiplexer demonstrates how design modularity scales while maintaining low area and delay.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for 4-to-1 MUX built using 2-to-1 MUXes.
