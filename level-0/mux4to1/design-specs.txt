Design Name: mux_4to1_using_mux2to1
Module Name:
- mux_4to1

Inputs:
- in     // 4-bit input bus (in[0] through in[3])
- sel    // 2-bit select signal (sel[1:0])

Outputs:
- out    // 1-bit output (selected value)

Design Signature:

// 4-to-1 Multiplexer using mux2to1
module mux_4to1 (
    input  [3:0] in,
    input  [1:0] sel,
    output       out
);

Design Notes:
- The 4-to-1 MUX must be constructed using three instances of the mux2to1 module:
    • First level: two mux2to1 units select between in[0] & in[1] and in[2] & in[3], both driven by sel[0]
    • Second level: one mux2to1 selects between the two first-level outputs, driven by sel[1]
- Use structural (instance-based) composition only; do not use behavioral constructs such as `assign out = ...`.
- Use clear, named port mappings for each instance (e.g., u0, u1, u2).
- Maintain consistency of signal naming and bus widths.
