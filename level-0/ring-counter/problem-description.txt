Title: 4-bit Ring Counter

Objective:
Design a 4-bit ring counter where a single '1' bit circulates through a shift register, producing a one-hot output pattern over time.

Background:
Ring counters are often used in FSM sequencing, timing circuits, and control signal generation due to their regular, predictable, and glitch-free output patterns. They require fewer decoding resources than binary counters for certain applications.

Design Constraints:
- The counter must be synchronous and operate on the rising clock edge.
- Implement using D flip-flops with synchronous reset.
- The counter should cycle through exactly 4 unique one-hot states.

Performance Expectation:
The design should demonstrate low switching activity and deterministic cycling.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the 4-bit ring counter.
