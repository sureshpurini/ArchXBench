Title: 8-bit Loadable Down Counter

Objective:
Design an 8-bit loadable down counter that loads an 8-bit value and counts down to zero on each clock cycle.

Background:
Down counters are commonly used in timing and control applications where a countdown from a specified value is needed.

Design Constraints:
- The counter must be synchronous, triggered on the rising edge of a clock.
- Must support synchronous active-high reset.
- Must have a `load` control signal and `din` input for loading the starting value.

Performance Expectation:
The counter should be resource-efficient and reset correctly, supporting load and countdown operations.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the 8-bit loadable down counter.
