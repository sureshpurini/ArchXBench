Title: 4-bit Comparator

Objective:
Design a 4-bit comparator that determines whether one 4-bit input is greater than, equal to, or less than the other.

Background:
Comparators are used widely in digital systems â€” for conditional branching, sorting, prioritization, and more. A modular comparator design demonstrates how smaller components can be composed to compare larger values.

Design Constraints:
- The 4-bit comparator must output three mutually exclusive status signals: greater than, equal, less than.
- All logic must be purely combinational.

Performance Expectation:
The 4-bit comparator should be small and fast.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the 4-bit comparator.
