Title: 8-bit Parallel-In Serial-Out (PISO) Shift Register

Objective:
Design an 8-bit PISO shift register that loads data in parallel and shifts it out serially.

Background:
PISO shift registers are used for serializing parallel data for transmission or storage in serial communication protocols.

Design Constraints:
- The design must be synchronous and triggered on the rising edge of a clock.
- Support for synchronous reset is required.
- Must include a `load` control signal for parallel data loading.

Performance Expectation:
The register should correctly load parallel data and shift it out serially, maintaining correct bit ordering.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the 8-bit PISO shift register.
