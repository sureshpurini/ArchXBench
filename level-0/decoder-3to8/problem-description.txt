Title: 3-to-8 Decoder using 2-to-4 Decoders

Objective:
Implement a 3-to-8 decoder hierarchically using only 2-to-4 decoder modules.

Background:
Decoders are combinational logic circuits that convert binary-encoded inputs into one-hot outputs. They are commonly used in address decoding, instruction decoding, and enabling circuits.

Design Constraints:
- The 3-to-8 decoder must use only 2-to-4 decoders for output expansion.
- The design must be purely combinational.

Performance Expectation:
Minimal propagation delay and regular structure. The 3-to-8 decoder must demonstrate effective logic reuse and modularity.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the 3-to-8 decoder built using 2-to-4 decoders.
