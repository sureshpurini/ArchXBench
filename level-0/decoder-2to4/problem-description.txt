Title: 2-to-4 Decoder

Objective:
Design a 2-to-4 decoder that activates one of four outputs based on a 2-bit input.

Background:
Decoders are combinational logic circuits that convert binary-encoded inputs into one-hot outputs. They are commonly used in address decoding, instruction decoding, and enabling circuits.

Design Constraints:
- The 2-to-4 decoder must be built from basic gates.
- The design must be purely combinational.

Performance Expectation:
Minimal propagation delay and regular structure.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the 2-to-4 decoder.
