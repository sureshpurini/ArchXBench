Title: Clock Divider (Fixed Divide-by-2)

Objective:
Design a simple synchronous clock divider that divides the input clock frequency by 2. This is a fixed-ratio divider with no runtime configuration and is commonly used in generating timing signals or reducing clock rates for slower components.

Background:
Divide-by-2 circuits are the simplest form of clock division and are often implemented using a T flip-flop or a D flip-flop with toggle logic. They are essential for basic frequency scaling in synchronous digital systems.

Design Constraints:
- Divide ratio is fixed at 2:1 (output frequency = input frequency รท 2).
- Must use synchronous logic, triggered on the rising edge of the input clock.
- Synchronous active-high reset must be supported.
- Output waveform must be a clean square wave with 50% duty cycle.

Performance Expectation:
Ultra-low resource usage and minimal logic delay. The module should act as a clean toggle flip-flop.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog  module for divide-by-2 clock.
