Title: 1-to-4 Demultiplexer using 1-to-2 Demultiplexers

Objective:
Extend the 1-to-2 demultiplexer design to construct a 1-to-4 demultiplexer using only 1-to-2 demultiplexers.

Background:
Demultiplexers (DEMUX) are used to route a single data line to one of several outputs, under control of select signals. Implementing larger demultiplexers using smaller ones encourages modular design and teaches hierarchical composition.

Design Constraints:
- The 1-to-4 DEMUX must be constructed entirely from three 1-to-2 DEMUX instances.
- The design must be purely combinational.

Performance Expectation:
The design should be minimal in logic depth and area. Timing is expected to be a function of the depth of demux levels (logâ‚‚N).

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the 1-to-4 demultiplexer built using 1-to-2 demultiplexers.
