Title: 2-to-1 Multiplexer

Objective:
Design a 2-to-1 multiplexer that selects one of two 1-bit input signals based on a 1-bit select signal.

Background:
Multiplexers are fundamental combinational logic elements that perform data selection. A 2-to-1 multiplexer chooses between two inputs using a single select line. This is one of the simplest forms of multiplexers and forms the building block for larger selection circuits.

Design Constraints:
- The 2-to-1 MUX must be implemented using basic gates (AND, OR, NOT).
- The design must be combinational (no clocking or memory elements).

Performance Expectation:
The 2-to-1 multiplexer is a small, low-latency combinational block and should synthesize to minimal area and delay.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for 2-to-1 MUX.
