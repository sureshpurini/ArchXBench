Title: 1-to-2 Demultiplexer

Objective:
Design a 1-to-2 demultiplexer that takes a 1-bit input and routes it to one of two output lines based on a 1-bit select signal.

Background:
Demultiplexers (DEMUX) are used to route a single data line to one of several outputs, under control of select signals. They are essential in digital systems for steering data, such as memory writes or bus routing.

Design Constraints:
- The 1-to-2 DEMUX should use basic logic gates (AND, NOT).
- The design must be purely combinational.

Performance Expectation:
The design should be minimal in logic depth and area.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the 1-to-2 demultiplexer.
