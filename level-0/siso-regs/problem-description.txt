Title: 8-bit Serial-In Serial-Out (SISO) Shift Register

Objective:
Design an 8-bit SISO shift register that shifts data serially in and out.

Background:
Shift registers are essential sequential circuits used for data storage, delay elements, and serial data processing in communication systems.

Design Constraints:
- The design must be synchronous and triggered on the rising edge of a clock.
- Support for synchronous reset is required.

Performance Expectation:
The register should correctly shift data in and out serially, maintaining bit order and timing alignment.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the 8-bit SISO shift register.
