Design Name: clock_divider
Module Name: clock_divider

Inputs:
- clk           // System clock input
- rst           // Synchronous active-high reset
- div_val[N-1:0] // Divider value (must be â‰¥ 2)

Outputs:
- clk_out       // Divided output clock signal

Design Signature:

module clock_divider (
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input [N-1:0] div_val,
    output clk_out
);

Design Notes:
- Use a counter that increments on every rising clock edge.
- When the counter reaches (div_val / 2) - 1, toggle the `clk_out` and reset the counter.
- This produces a square wave with approximately 50% duty cycle.
- The module should be parameterized with respect to N (bit-width of divider).
- Ensure correct behavior when `div_val` is changed dynamically during runtime.
- Reset should asynchronously reset the counter and `clk_out` to 0.
