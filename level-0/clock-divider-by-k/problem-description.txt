Title: Clock Divider

Objective:
Design a clock divider module that takes a system clock as input and produces an output clock signal with a user-configurable divide ratio. The output clock frequency should be an integer division of the input clock frequency.

Background:
Clock dividers are widely used in digital systems to generate lower-frequency clocks for timers, UARTs, PWM generators, and synchronization between different subsystems. A typical implementation uses a counter to toggle the output clock after a certain number of input clock cycles.

Design Constraints:
- The divider must be synchronous and operate on the rising edge of the input clock.
- The divide value should be configurable at runtime through an input port.
- The output clock should have a 50% duty cycle when the divide value is even.
- Implement a synchronous active-high reset.

Performance Expectation:
The output clock should be glitch-free and switch with predictable timing. The divider should support a wide range of divide values and toggle cleanly across different ratios.

Deliverables:
- A synthesizable Verilog module.
