Title: 8-bit Binary Up Counter

Objective:
Design an 8-bit binary up counter that counts from 0 to 255 with each clock cycle.

Background:
Binary counters are sequential building blocks used for counting events, timing generation, and state control. They increment their count value on each clock edge.

Design Constraints:
- The counter must be synchronous, triggered on the rising edge of a clock.
- Must support synchronous active-high reset.

Performance Expectation:
The counter should be resource-efficient and reset correctly.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the 8-bit binary up counter.
