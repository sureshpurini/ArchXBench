Title: 8-bit Gray Code Counter

Objective:
Design an 8-bit Gray code counter that generates a sequence of 8-bit Gray codes where only one bit changes between consecutive values.

Background:
Gray code counters are useful in low-power and asynchronous designs due to minimal bit transitions. They ensure that only a single bit changes at a time, reducing switching noise and power consumption.

Design Constraints:
- The counter must be synchronous, triggered on the rising edge of a clock.
- Must support synchronous active-high reset.
- Must ensure correct bit transitions following Gray encoding.

Performance Expectation:
The counter should follow a valid Gray code sequence without glitches.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the 8-bit Gray code counter.
