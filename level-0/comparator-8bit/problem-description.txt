Title: 8-bit Comparator using Two 4-bit Comparators

Objective:
Build an 8-bit comparator hierarchically using two 4-bit comparators to compare 8-bit inputs.

Background:
Comparators are used widely in digital systems â€” for conditional branching, sorting, prioritization, and more. A modular comparator design demonstrates how smaller components can be composed to compare larger values.

Design Constraints:
- The 8-bit comparator must re-use the 4-bit comparator as a subcomponent.
- All logic must be purely combinational.

Performance Expectation:
The 8-bit comparator will exhibit slightly longer delay due to hierarchical evaluation but should still be suitable for single-cycle comparison in most systems.

Deliverables:
- A Verilog module for the 8-bit comparator built using two 4-bit comparators.
