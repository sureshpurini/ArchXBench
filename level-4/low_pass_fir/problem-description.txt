Title: Low-Pass FIR Filter — Streaming DSP Pipeline

Objective:
Design a parameterizable streaming hardware accelerator that performs low-pass finite-impulse-response (FIR) filtering on serial input data. The engine must sustain one sample per clock after the tap pipeline is filled, supporting fixed or run-time-programmable coefficients.

Background:
Low-pass filters are essential for noise reduction and anti-aliasing in digital communications and audio. A linear-phase FIR implemented with a symmetric tap set enables efficient multiplier reuse and predictable group delay.

Design Constraints:
- Input: serial data stream (one sample/clock).
- Filter length: odd, 15 – 127 taps.
- Arithmetic: fixed-point (configurable width) with optional floating-point mode.
- Throughput: 1 sample/clock once pipeline is full.
- Edge handling: implicit zero-extension beyond data boundaries.
- Coefficient storage: ROM or RAM; run-time reload optional.

Performance Expectation:
After an initial latency of `TAP_CNT-1` cycles plus internal MAC depth, the core delivers one filtered sample each clock at full throughput.

Deliverables:
- Verilog (or HLS) implementation of lowpass_fir.
- Parameterizable symmetric tap engine and testbench with impulse/step/noise stimuli.
