Title: High-Pass FIR Filter — Streaming DSP Pipeline

Objective:
Design a parameterizable streaming hardware accelerator that performs high-pass FIR filtering on serial input data, eliminating low-frequency or DC components. Like the low-pass core, it must output one sample per cycle after pipeline fill.

Background:
High-pass filters are widely used for AC coupling in sensor interfaces and audio processing. An FIR HPF can be derived from a low-pass prototype via spectral inversion, leading to coefficients with zero DC gain.

Design Constraints:
- Input: serial data stream (one sample/clock).
- Filter length: odd, 15 – 127 taps.
- Arithmetic: fixed-point (configurable width) with optional floating-point mode.
- Throughput: 1 sample/clock after latency period.
- Edge handling: implicit zero-extension.
- Coefficient source: ROM, RAM, or spectral-invert generator.

Performance Expectation:
Identical to low-pass: steady-state 1 sample/clock with latency `TAP_CNT-1` + MAC depth.

Deliverables:
- Verilog (or HLS) implementation of highpass_fir.
