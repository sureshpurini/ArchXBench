Design Name:
  cla_8bit

Module Name:
  cla_8bit

Inputs:
  - A [7:0]: 8-bit operand A.
  - B [7:0]: 8-bit operand B.
  - Cin (1-bit): Initial carry-in input for the least significant bit.

Outputs:
  - Sum [7:0]: 8-bit sum output of A + B + Cin.
  - Cout (1-bit): Final carry-out after the addition.

Design Signature:
  module cla_8bit (
      input  [7:0] A,
      input  [7:0] B,
      input        Cin,
      output [7:0] Sum,
      output       Cout
  );

Design Notes:
  - The design uses a carry look-ahead logic approach to accelerate carry generation and reduce delay.
  - It precomputes carry signals using generate (G) and propagate (P) terms for each bit position.
  - Carry signals (C1 to C7) are derived using Boolean expressions based on G and P values, reducing carry propagation delay.
  - The CLA logic can be implemented either hierarchically (e.g., with a 4-bit CLA unit) or as a flat 8-bit unit.
  - No clocking or sequential logic is used â€” the design is fully combinational.
  - Improves performance over ripple carry adder at the cost of increased logic complexity and area.
