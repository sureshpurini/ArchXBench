Design Name:

lfsr_stream_cipher

Module Name:

lfsr_stream_cipher

Inputs:
clk: Clock signal for synchronous operation of the LFSR.
rst: Reset signal to initialize the LFSR to a known state.
seed [N-1:0]: The N-bit seed value to initialize the register (non-zero to ensure maximal length).
enable: Control signal to start or pause the LFSR operation.

Outputs:
lfsr_out: The current output bit generated by the LFSR, representing the pseudorandom stream.
state [N-1:0]: The current state of the register for debugging or further processing.

Design Signature:
module lfsr_stream_cipher #(
    parameter N = 8,
    parameter LFSR_POLY = 8'b10001110
)(
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input [N-1:0] seed,
    input enable,
    output reg lfsr_out,
    output reg [N-1:0] state
);

Design Notes:
- The design should implement an n-bit LFSR using a configurable primitive feedback polynomial.
- On reset, the LFSR should load the provided seed value, ensuring the seed is non-zero to avoid lockup.
- With each clock cycle (when enabled), the module shifts the register contents and computes the new bit using XOR logic as defined by the feedback taps.
- The design should be fully parameterized to support various register sizes and associated feedback polynomials for different cryptographic strengths.
- Care should be taken to optimize the logic for minimal propagation delay and power consumption, while ensuring that the pseudorandom output meets the desired statistical properties for secure stream cipher applications.
