Title:
- Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) for Stream Cipher Primitives

Objective:
- The goal is to design and implement a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) module that serves as a key stream generator for stream cipher applications.
- The module should generate pseudorandom bit sequences based on a configurable feedback polynomial, which is essential for cryptographic stream ciphers.

Background:
- Linear Feedback Shift Registers are widely used in cryptography for generating pseudorandom bit streams, a critical component in many stream cipher systems.
- LFSRs are valued for their simplicity, low hardware cost, and ability to produce sequences with long periods, provided that an appropriate feedback polynomial is chosen.
- Stream cipher primitives based on LFSRs have applications in secure communications, data encryption, and digital broadcasting, where high-speed and resource-efficient operations are mandatory.

Design Constraints:
- The design should be parameterizable in terms of register width and feedback polynomial to allow flexible security and performance trade-offs.
- It must include control mechanisms such as clock and reset signals, and support an initialization (or seeding) phase to set the LFSRâ€™s starting state.
- The implementation must ensure that the chosen feedback polynomial is primitive, guaranteeing maximal-length sequences for robust randomness in stream cipher applications.
- Considerations include minimizing logic complexity and power consumption while ensuring the pseudorandom output meets statistical randomness requirements.

Performance Expectation:
- The design is expected to operate at high frequency, producing one pseudorandom bit (or word) per clock cycle with minimal latency.
- It should balance between area, power, and throughput, maintaining robust pseudorandom sequence generation even in resource-constrained environments.
- The circuit should be efficient enough for integration into larger cryptographic systems, with verified statistical properties of the generated sequences.

Deliverables:
- A synthesizable HDL module (Verilog/VHDL) implementing the LFSR for stream cipher primitives.
