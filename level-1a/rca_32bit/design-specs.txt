Design Name: rca_32bit
Module Name: rca_32bit

Inputs:
- a[31:0]   // First 32-bit operand
- b[31:0]   // Second 32-bit operand
- cin       // Carry-in bit (1-bit)

Outputs:
- sum[31:0] // 32-bit sum output
- cout      // Carry-out bit (1-bit)

Design Signature:
    module rca_32bit (
        input  [31:0] a,
        input  [31:0] b,
        input         cin,
        output [31:0] sum,
        output        cout
    );

Design Notes:
- The design should instantiate 32 full adder units (or their logic equivalent).
- The carry-out of each adder must feed into the next stage in order.
- Final carry-out should be connected to the output port `cout`.
- All logic should be synthesizable and suitable for FPGA or ASIC mapping.
