Title: S-Box Implementation using Lookup Table

Objective:
Design a hardware module that performs the **AES SubBytes operation** by mapping an 8-bit input to an 8-bit output through a fixed nonlinear transformation known as the **S-Box**. Benchmark implementation:
**Lookup Table (LUT)** based using a ROM or case statement


Background:
The AES S-Box is derived from the multiplicative inverse in GF(2⁸), followed by an affine transformation. It introduces non-linearity into AES and is one of the most security-critical operations in the cipher. A LUT-based approach is fast but area-intensive. 

Design Constraints:
- Input: 8-bit byte (0x00 to 0xFF)
- Output: 8-bit substitution value from fixed S-Box table
- LUT must support constant-time access (array, case, or ROM)
- Synthesis-friendly and timing-aware

Performance Expectation:
LUT version: 1-cycle combinational delay  

Deliverables:
- Verilog implementation of S-Box:
  • LUT version using case or ROM
