Design Name:
- pipelined_rca_32bit

Module Name:
- pipelined_rca_32bit

Inputs:
- clk: Clock signal for synchronizing the pipelined operations.
- rst: Reset signal to clear internal registers and initialize the pipeline.
- A [31:0]: The first 32-bit operand for the addition.
- B [31:0]: The second 32-bit operand for the addition.
- cin: 1-bit carry-in input to initiate the addition.

Outputs:
- sum [31:0]: The 32-bit result of the addition.
- cout: 1-bit carry-out signal from the most significant stage, indicating an overflow or carry-out.

Design Signature:
module pipelined_rca_32bit(
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input [31:0] A,
    input [31:0] B,
    input cin,
    output reg [31:0] sum,
    output reg cout
);

Design Notes:
- The adder is divided into four pipeline stages, each responsible for processing 8 bits of the overall 32-bit addition.
- Each stage computes a partial sum and produces a carry-out that serves as the carry-in for the subsequent stage.
- Pipeline registers will be inserted between stages to hold intermediate sums and carry values, creating a latency of 4 clock cycles from the initial input to the final output.
- The design should handle proper reset behavior to ensure that the pipeline registers are initialized to known states.
- Emphasis should be placed on balancing the delay across the four stages to meet high-frequency timing requirements while minimizing ripple delay within each 8-bit segment.
