Design Name:
- pipelined_cla_32bit

Module Name:
- pipelined_cla_32bit

Inputs:
- clk: Clock signal for synchronizing pipeline stages.
- rst: Reset signal to initialize pipeline registers and internal logic.
- A [31:0]: The first 32-bit operand for the addition.
- B [31:0]: The second 32-bit operand for the addition.
- cin: 1-bit carry-in input to initiate the addition operation.

Outputs:
- sum [31:0]: The 32-bit result of the addition operation.
- cout: 1-bit carry-out signal from the final stage, indicating an overflow or final carry.

Design Signature:
module pipelined_cla_32bit(
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input [31:0] A,
    input [31:0] B,
    input cin,
    output reg [31:0] sum,
    output reg cout
);

Design Notes:
- The adder is divided into four pipeline stages, with each stage responsible for processing 8 bits of the overall 32-bit addition.
- Each stage computes its partial sum along with propagate (P) and generate (G) signals that are used in the carry lookahead logic to determine the carry for the subsequent stage.
- Pipeline registers are introduced between stages to store intermediate sums and carry signals, resulting in a fixed latency of 4 clock cycles from input to final sum output.
- The CLA logic is structured hierarchically, enabling parallel computation of carry signals to minimize delay.
- The design should ensure balanced stage delays, proper reset initialization, and optimized timing paths to support high-frequency operation.
