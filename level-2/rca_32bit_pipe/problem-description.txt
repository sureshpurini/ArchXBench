Title:
- Pipelined 32-bit Ripple Carry Adder (4 Stages)

Objective:
- The goal is to design and implement a pipelined 32-bit ripple carry adder that partitions the addition process into four distinct pipeline stages.
- The module should compute the sum of two 32-bit operands while propagating carry signals through each pipeline stage to achieve high throughput.

Background:
- The ripple carry adder is a fundamental building block in digital arithmetic circuits, where the carry-out from each bit addition serves as the carry-in for the next bit.
- By pipelining the adder, the overall combinational delay is segmented into smaller, manageable stages, enabling the circuit to operate at a higher clock frequency.
- Pipelined designs are critical in high-performance systems where throughput is prioritized over the latency of individual operations.

Design Constraints:
- The design must support 32-bit addition, partitioning the operation into four pipeline stages (each handling 8 bits).
- The module should incorporate synchronous logic with defined clock and reset signals.
- Pipeline registers must be used between each stage to store intermediate results and carry signals.
- The design must account for a fixed latency of 4 clock cycles, with each stage introducing one cycle of delay.

Performance Expectation:
- The pipelined structure is intended to achieve a higher clock frequency and increased throughput compared to a non-pipelined ripple carry adder.
- There is a trade-off between latency (4 clock cycles delay from input to output) and overall performance gains in speed.
- Area and power consumption may increase due to additional pipeline registers, but the design should maintain accurate and precise 32-bit addition.

Deliverables:
- A synthesizable HDL module (Verilog/VHDL) implementing the four-stage pipelined 32-bit ripple carry adder.
- A complete testbench covering a range of input scenarios to verify correctness and timing.
- Simulation and synthesis reports, including metrics on timing, area, and power consumption.
