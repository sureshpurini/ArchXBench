Title:
- Pipelined 32-bit CLA Adder (4 Stages)

Objective:
- The goal is to design and implement a pipelined 32-bit Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA) that segments the addition process into four pipeline stages.
- The module should compute the sum of two 32-bit operands while leveraging carry lookahead logic to accelerate carry propagation across the stages.

Background:
- Carry Lookahead Adders (CLA) are widely used in high-speed arithmetic circuits due to their ability to reduce the delay associated with carry propagation.
- Pipelining the CLA into multiple stages allows for higher clock frequencies and increased throughput by breaking down the addition into smaller, faster segments.
- This component is critical in high-performance digital systems, such as microprocessors and DSPs, where fast and efficient arithmetic operations are essential.

Design Constraints:
- The design must support 32-bit addition partitioned into four pipeline stages, with each stage handling 8 bits.
- Synchronous logic is required, with clearly defined clock and reset signals, and pipeline registers must be used between stages to store intermediate results.
- The carry lookahead logic must be optimized to compute carries in parallel, reducing overall delay.
- Constraints include managing fixed latency (4 clock cycles from input to output) and ensuring balanced logic delays across all stages for high-frequency operation.

Performance Expectation:
- The pipelined CLA is intended to achieve higher throughput compared to non-pipelined designs by reducing the effective propagation delay through pipelining.
- There is a trade-off in that the overall latency is fixed at 4 clock cycles; however, the high operating frequency compensates with increased throughput.
- The design should balance speed, area, and power consumption, ensuring that the added complexity from pipelining does not result in excessive resource usage.

Deliverables:
- A synthesizable HDL module (Verilog/VHDL) implementing the 4-stage pipelined 32-bit CLA adder.
