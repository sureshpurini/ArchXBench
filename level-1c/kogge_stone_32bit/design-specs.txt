Design Name:
  ksa_32bit

Module Name:
  ksa_32bit

Inputs:
  - A [31:0]: 32-bit operand A.
  - B [31:0]: 32-bit operand B.
  - Cin (1-bit): Initial carry-in signal (typically set to 0).

Outputs:
  - Sum [31:0]: 32-bit sum output of A + B + Cin.
  - Cout (1-bit): Final carry-out after the addition.

Design Signature:
  module ksa_32bit (
      input  [31:0] A,
      input  [31:0] B,
      input         Cin,
      output [31:0] Sum,
      output        Cout
  );

Design Notes:
  - Implements a parallel prefix adder based on the Kogge-Stone architecture.
  - Uses generate (G) and propagate (P) terms to compute carries in logarithmic time.
  - Organized in log2(N) stages with increasing group sizes for fast carry computation.
  - Each stage performs prefix operations using black and gray cells to propagate carry.
  - Very high-speed design suitable for timing-critical arithmetic units, though more complex and area-intensive.
  - The initial stage computes bitwise G and P; intermediate stages perform prefix operations; final stage computes sum bits.
  - Fully combinational and synthesizable; no clock signals involved.
