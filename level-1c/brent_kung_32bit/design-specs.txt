Design Name:
  bka_32bit

Module Name:
  bka_32bit

Inputs:
  - A [31:0]: 32-bit operand A.
  - B [31:0]: 32-bit operand B.
  - Cin (1-bit): Initial carry-in input (typically 0).

Outputs:
  - Sum [31:0]: 32-bit sum output of A + B + Cin.
  - Cout (1-bit): Final carry-out of the addition.

Design Signature:
  module bka_32bit (
      input  [31:0] A,
      input  [31:0] B,
      input         Cin,
      output [31:0] Sum,
      output        Cout
  );

Design Notes:
  - This design implements a parallel prefix adder using the Brent-Kung topology.
  - The Brent-Kung Adder is a type of logarithmic-time adder that uses a balanced approach to carry computation.
  - Uses generate (G) and propagate (P) signals for each bit to calculate carry bits in a tree-structured network.
  - Brent-Kung offers a good trade-off between performance (O(logâ‚‚N) delay) and resource usage (fewer logic gates than Kogge-Stone).
  - Comprises three stages: 
    1. Preprocessing (computes G and P for each bit),
    2. Prefix tree (propagates carries efficiently),
    3. Postprocessing (computes sum).
  - Fully combinational, synthesizable SystemVerilog design with no clocking logic.
