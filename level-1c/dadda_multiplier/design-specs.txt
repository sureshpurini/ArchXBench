Design Name: Dadda Multiplier
Module Name: dadda_mult

Inputs:
- A[7:0]                   // First 8-bit operand
- B[7:0]                   // Second 8-bit operand

Outputs:
- Y[15:0]                  // 16-bit product result

Parameters:
None (fixed 8-bit implementation)

Design Signature:

module dadda_mult(
    input [7:0] A,
    input [7:0] B,
    output [15:0] Y
);

Submodules:
1. Half Adder (HA)
   module HA(
       input a, b,
       output Sum, Cout
   );

2. Carry Save Adder (CSA)
   module csa(
       input A, B, Cin,
       output Y, Cout
   );

Internal Structure:
- Partial Product Generation: 64 partial products (8×8 matrix)
- Wire Declarations:
  - Stage 1: s1[5:0], c1[5:0] (reducing from 8 to 6 rows)
  - Stage 2: s2[13:0], c2[13:0] (reducing from 6 to 4 rows)
  - Stage 3: s3[9:0], c3[9:0] (reducing from 4 to 3 rows)
  - Stage 4: s4[11:0], c4[11:0] (reducing from 3 to 2 rows)
  - Stage 5: c5[13:0] (final carries for 2 to 1 reduction)

Key Implementation Details:
1. Partial Product Generation: Computed using bitwise AND operations
2. Reduction Strategy:
   - Strategic placement of half adders and carry-save adders
   - Five-stage reduction following Dadda's height sequence (8→6→4→3→2→1)
3. Final Output Formation:
   - LSB (Y[0]) directly assigned from first partial product
   - Bits Y[1] through Y[14] computed through the reduction stages
   - MSB (Y[15]) assigned from the final carry
