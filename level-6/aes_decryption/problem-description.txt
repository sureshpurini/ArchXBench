Title: AES-128 Decryption Pipeline Accelerator

Objective:
Design a fully-pipelined hardware accelerator that performs AES-128 block decryption at a throughput of one 128-bit block per clock after pipeline fill. Must integrate inverse key-expansion and execute the ten inverse rounds (InvShiftRows, InvSubBytes, AddRoundKey, InvMixColumns).

Background:
AES decryption reverses the encryption process to recover plaintext. Hardware support for decryption is critical in secure storage controllers, encrypted network endpoints, and protocol offload engines.

Design Constraints:
- Input: 128-bit ciphertext and 128-bit key, supplied when `start` and `valid_in` are asserted.
- Mode: decryption only (fixed at mode=1).
- Latency: pipeline depth determined by inline key schedule inversion.
- Throughput: one decrypted block per cycle once the pipeline is full.
- Key Expansion: inline inverse key schedule must be pipelined.
- Control: handshake via `valid_in`/`valid_out` and a `done` flag.

Performance Expectation:
After an initial inverse-round latency, the core must accept a new ciphertext each cycle and produce plaintext each cycle.

Deliverables:
- Verilog module `aes128_pipeline` (decryption mode).
