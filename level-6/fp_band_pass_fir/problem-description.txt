Title: Floating‐Point Band‐Pass FIR Filter — Streaming DSP Pipeline

Objective:
Design a parameterizable streaming hardware accelerator that performs band‐pass FIR filtering on a stream of 32‐bit IEEE‐754 single‐precision floats (hex‐encoded). Must pass a selectable frequency band and attenuate outside frequencies. After the pipeline fill, produce one output per clock.

Background:
Band‐pass FIR filters are employed in communications, biomedical instruments, and audio equalization to isolate a specific frequency band. Floating‐point realization simplifies coefficient design and ensures wide dynamic range.

Design Constraints:
- Input: 32‐bit IEEE‐754 floats (hex) one sample/clock, with valid_in handshake.
- Filter length: odd taps, configurable from 31 to 255.
- Coefficients: 32‐bit floats for a band‐pass design (e.g., windowed sinc difference of two low‐pass prototypes), preloaded or loaded at runtime.
- Throughput: 1 sample/clock after (TAP_CNT−1) + MAC pipeline depths.
- Edge handling: implicit zero‐extension.
- Arithmetic: pipelined IEEE‐754 multipliers and adders.
- Handshaking: valid_in/valid_out, no back‐pressure assumed.

Performance Expectation:
Once (TAP_CNT−1) + internal pipeline cycles have passed, accept a new floating‐point sample every cycle and produce one floating‐point filtered output every cycle.

Deliverables:
- Verilog module `fp_bandpass_fir`.
