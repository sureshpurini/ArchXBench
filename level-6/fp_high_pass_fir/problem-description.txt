Title: Floating‐Point High‐Pass FIR Filter — Streaming DSP Pipeline

Objective:
Design a parameterizable streaming hardware accelerator that performs high‐pass FIR filtering on a stream of 32‐bit IEEE‐754 single‐precision floats (hex‐encoded). After initial latency, the core must produce one high‐pass‐filtered sample per cycle.

Background:
A high‐pass FIR filter is derived via spectral inversion of a low‐pass prototype, canceling DC and low‐frequency content. Floating‐point implementation avoids quantization issues for audio and biomedical signals.

Design Constraints:
- Input: 32‐bit IEEE‐754 floats (hex) at one sample/clock, with valid_in handshake.
- Filter length: odd taps, configurable from 15 to 127.
- Coefficients: 32‐bit floats for high‐pass response, preloaded or loaded at runtime.
- Throughput: 1 sample/clock after (TAP_CNT−1) + MAC pipeline depths.
- Edge handling: implicit zero‐extension.
- Arithmetic: pipelined IEEE‐754 multiplier and adder trees.
- Handshaking: valid_in/valid_out, no back‐pressure.

Performance Expectation:
After pipeline fill (TAP_CNT−1 cycles + internal pipeline delays), produce one floating‐point high‐pass sample each cycle.

Deliverables:
- Verilog module `fp_highpass_fir`.
