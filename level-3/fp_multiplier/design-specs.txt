Design Name:
- floating_point_multiplier

Module Name:
- floating_point_multiplier

Inputs:
- clk: Clock signal for synchronizing operations (required for pipelined/sequential designs).
- rst: Reset signal to initialize or synchronize internal states.
- a [WIDTH-1:0]: The first floating point operand in the defined format (e.g., IEEE 754 format), where WIDTH parameterizes the overall bit-width.
- b [WIDTH-1:0]: The second floating point operand in the same floating point format.
- rnd_mode [2:0]: (Optional) Rounding mode control signal specifying the rounding strategy (e.g., round to nearest, round toward zero, etc.).

Outputs:
- product [WIDTH-1:0]: The computed floating point result of the multiplication.
- exception_flags [2:0]: Flags indicating any exceptional conditions encountered during computation (e.g., overflow, underflow, invalid operation).

Design Signature:
module floating_point_multiplier(
    input clk,
    input rst,
    input [WIDTH-1:0] a,
    input [WIDTH-1:0] b,
    input [2:0] rnd_mode, // Optional: specifies the rounding mode
    output reg [WIDTH-1:0] product,
    output reg [2:0] exception_flags
);

Design Notes:
- Implement exponent handling by adding the exponents of the two operands and then subtracting the bias to adjust the result.
- Multiply the significands (mantissas) of the operands, taking care to manage any bit growth and provide sufficient precision for normalization.
- Integrate a normalization stage that shifts the result as required, adjusts the exponent accordingly, and applies the selected rounding mode.
- Include exception handling logic to detect and signal overflow, underflow, invalid operations, and any other specified conditions.
- Consider pipelining critical stages (multiplication, normalization, rounding) to achieve high throughput without compromising timing in deep sub-micron technologies.
- Ensure that the design is fully parameterized (e.g., EXP_WIDTH, MANT_WIDTH, and WIDTH) for flexibility in supporting different floating point standards.
