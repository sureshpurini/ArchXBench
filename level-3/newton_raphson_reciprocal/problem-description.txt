Title:
- Reciprocal Calculation using Newton-Raphson Method with Fixed-Point Arithmetic

Objective:
- The goal is to design and implement a module capable of calculating the reciprocal of an input number using Newton-Raphson's iterative method.
- The module should accept and produce input and output values in fixed-point format, ensuring high precision and efficient hardware implementation.

Background:
- Newton-Raphson's method is a numerical technique for finding successively better approximations to the roots (or zeroes) of a real-valued function.
- For reciprocal calculation, the method is applied to the function f(y) = 1 - X × y, where X is the input number and y is the reciprocal estimate.
- The iterative formula is: yₙ₊₁ = yₙ × (2 - X × yₙ).
- Fixed-point representation is a numerical format used in hardware designs to trade off precision and resource usage by representing numbers with a fixed number of fractional bits.

Design Constraints:
- The design should support configurable bit-widths (e.g., 16-bit, 32-bit) for the input number, with a parameterized number of fractional bits (`m`).
- It must handle fixed-point arithmetic correctly, including appropriate scaling and normalization to ensure accurate results.
- The implementation should include a control finite state machine (FSM) to manage the iterative processing steps, convergence checking, and output readiness.
- Clocking assumptions, timing constraints, and reset behavior must be clearly defined and adhered to for proper integration into larger systems.

Performance Expectation:
- The design should balance between speed, area, and power consumption.
- A sequential implementation may target a reduced gate count and lower power at the cost of increased latency, whereas a combinational approach should meet stringent timing requirements.
- The module must produce correct and precise outputs while optimizing the number of iterations for convergence, with considerations for fixed-point precision and rounding.

Deliverables:
- A synthesizable HDL module (Verilog/VHDL) implementing the reciprocal calculation using Newton-Raphson's method with fixed-point arithmetic.
