Design Name:
- newton_raphson_poly_fixedpoint

Module Name:
- newton_raphson_poly_fixedpoint

Inputs:
- x_init [n-1:0]: The initial guess for the polynomial root in fixed-point format (n-bit unsigned, with m fractional bits).
- coeff0 [n-1:0], coeff1 [n-1:0], coeff2 [n-1:0], coeff3 [n-1:0]: Polynomial coefficients for p(x)=a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2 + coeff3*x^3, provided in fixed-point format.
- clk: Clock signal (drives the sequential operations).
- rst: Reset signal (synchronously or asynchronously resets internal state registers).
- start: Start signal that latches the input x_init and initiates a new computation.

Outputs:
- root [n-1:0]: The computed root of the polynomial (the value of x such that p(x)≈0), represented in fixed-point format.
- ready: Status flag indicating that the iterative computation is complete and the root is valid.
- valid: (Optional) A flag from the verification block indicating that the computed root meets additional user-defined specifications or criteria.

);

Design Notes:
- The module implements Newton-Raphson’s method to find a real root of the polynomial p(x)=0. The iterative recurrence is:
      x_next = x - p(x) * inv_p_prime
  where inv_p_prime is the fixed-point reciprocal of p'(x). For efficient hardware design, the reciprocal can be computed externally or via a dedicated block.

- Polynomial evaluation is performed using Horner's method:
      p(x) = coeff0 + coeff1*x + coeff2*x^2 + coeff3*x^3
  Likewise, the derivative is computed as:
      p'(x) = coeff1 + 2*coeff2*x + 3*coeff3*x^2

- Fixed-point arithmetic is implemented with an n-bit format and m fractional bits (denoted as Qn.m). Extended precision for intermediate results is used to minimize overflow issues.

- The design includes a finite state machine (FSM) with the following states:
    - IDLE: Waits for the 'start' signal to latch x_init and initialize the computation.
    - CALC: Iteratively computes p(x) and p'(x), applies the recurrence, and refines the root until convergence or a preset iteration count is reached.
    - VERIFY: After a candidate root is obtained, a verification block checks whether |p(x)| is within a specified tolerance or meets other design criteria.
    - DONE: Announces the final root by asserting the 'ready' flag, and sets the 'valid' flag according to the verification result. The design remains in DONE until an external reset is issued.

- Verification Block:
    - Once the iterative process converges in the CALC state, the candidate root is evaluated in the verification block.
    - Criteria include ensuring |p(root)| is below a tolerance and any additional user-defined conditions.
    - The result of these checks determines the setting of the valid flag.

- Multiple Roots Consideration:
    - Because Newton-Raphson’s method is local, the process will converge to the root nearest to the initial guess. Multiple valid roots require careful selection or additional logic to choose the desired one.

- Parameterization:
    - The design supports varying bit-widths and even different polynomial degrees, making it easier to integrate into a range of systems.

Updated Revision Note:
Below are the updated files. In this version, modifications include the use of "<<" (left-shift) operators instead of "<<<" to secure correct scaling and arithmetic operations. Additionally, the Newton update has been refined by introducing a dedicated fixed-point division function using extended-width arithmetic, and the derivative calculation has been updated accordingly. These changes ensure that the iteration progresses correctly rather than stalling at the initial guess, yielding a more accurate Newton–Raphson update.
