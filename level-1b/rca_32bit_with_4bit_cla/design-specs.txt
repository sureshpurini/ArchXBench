Design Name:
- rca_32bit_4bit_cla

Module Name:
- rca_32bit_4bit_cla

Inputs:
- A [31:0]: The first 32-bit operand for the addition.
- B [31:0]: The second 32-bit operand for the addition.
- cin: A 1-bit input carry to initialize the addition.

Outputs:
- sum [31:0]: The 32-bit result of the addition.
- cout: A 1-bit output carry produced by the final 4-bit CLA block.

Design Signature:
module rca_32bit_4bit_cla(
    input [31:0] A,
    input [31:0] B,
    input cin,
    output [31:0] sum,
    output cout
);

Design Notes:
- The 32-bit operands are divided into eight 4-bit segments. Each segment is processed by a 4-bit Carry Lookahead Adder to quickly compute the sum and generate local carry signals.
- The carry-out from each 4-bit CLA block is connected as the carry-in for the next block, forming a ripple carry chain between the segments.
- Care must be taken to ensure proper balancing of delay between the CLA blocks so that the overall propagation delay is minimized.
- The design is intended to be combinational, but it can be adapted to a pipelined structure if higher throughput is required.
- Parameterization should be considered where possible to allow modifications in block size or support for additional features.
